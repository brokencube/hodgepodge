Preliminary upload of personal web library.

Current dependancies:
* PHP 5.3+ (5.4 recommended)

Dependancies for specific functionality
* Memcached or PEAR Cache_Lite (For caching)
* MySQL 5.0+ (For database classes)
* Imagick extension (For image class)
* Linux OS (For socket classes)
* Smarty3 or RainTPL3 (For templates)

Various things still missing from the library - it gets updated as I need new features, or find bugs that are actively affecting me.

Rewritten recently to be compliant with [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md), [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) and [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standards. See http://www.php-fig.org for more details.
