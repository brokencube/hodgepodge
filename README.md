New home of my personal microframework 

Current dependancies:
* PHP 5.4

Dependancies for specific functionality
* Memcached or PEAR Cache_Lite (For caching)
* MySQLi (For database functionality)
* Imagick extension (For image processing class)

Various things still missing from the library - it gets updated as I need new features, or find bugs that are actively affecting me.

I've tried to clean up the code to be (99%) compliant with [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md), [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) and [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standards. (See http://www.php-fig.org for more details.) There might be a few places that I haven't fixed up yet.
